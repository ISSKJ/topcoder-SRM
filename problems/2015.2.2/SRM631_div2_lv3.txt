Problem Statement

Cat Taro likes coins. For any non-negative integer K, he has exactly two coins of value 2^K (i.e., two to the power of K).

You are given a long N. Return the number of different ways Taro can represent the value N with coins that he has. (Two representations are considered different if there is a value that occurs a different number of times in the representations.)
